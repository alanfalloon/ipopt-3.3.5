-----------

Installation:

1. Before you run Ipopt's configure, you need to set the JAVA_HOME
   environment variable to the directory that contains your JDK, e.g.,

   /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0

2. Follow the regular Ipopt installation instructions.  After the
   final 'make install' go into the subdirectory

   Ipopt/contrib/JavaInterface

   of the directory where you can configure and make install

3. Type 'make' to compile the JNI interface code and the JIpopt class.
   This will generate the shared object

   lib/libjipopt.so

   and the class

   org/coinor/Ipopt.class

4. With 'make test' you can run two example problems.

-----------

Usage:

If you want to use Ipopt from Java, all you need to include is the
org/coinor/Ipopt.class file.  At runtime, there must be the
lib/libjipopt.so file.


(So far, this has only been tested on Linux...)
